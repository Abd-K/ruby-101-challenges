## Background



## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `build_name` that builds a full name base on a first, middle and last name.
- This method should take three arguments (first, middle and last names), all `Strings`, and **return** another `String`, the full name.

`build_name("Alex", "Arthur", "Benoit")` should return `"Alex Arthur Benoit"`

- Use the defined method with you first, middle and last name.

## Key Learning Points

- Methods
- Methods **return** something and then you operate on that (for example you can `puts` it)
- Interpolation
- Methods Parameters vs. Arguments

## Background

**Interpolation** is very powerful. Let's use basic math inside an interpolation to indicate our age in 3 years. Don't forget to **assign** the age variable!

## Specs

- Assign the `age` with your age
- Use basic math (it's Ruby code) inside the interpolation of the message accordingly
- Run the Ruby program by executing in the **Terminal** `ruby future_age.rb`

## Key Learning Points

- Ruby code inside interpolations
- Fixnums
